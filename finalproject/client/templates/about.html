        <h1 class="font-effect-3d-float">About</h1><br>
        Thanks for visiting my site! In this site, I used many different packages to get here, but ultimately in the end I am using:
      <ul>
        <li>Iron Router</li>
        <li>CollectionsFS</li>
        <li>GridFS</li>
        <li>AWS (Amazon Web Services)</li>
        <li>Font Awesome</li>
        <li>and many more that I am forgetting as I write this out.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="font-effect-3d-float">Iron Router</h2><br>
        <p>Iron Router is the newest form of routing for Meteor apps! It centralizes all of the routing so that it is very easy to maintain large website!</p>
        <h2 class="font-effect-3d-float">CollectionsFS</h2><br>
        <p>CollectionFS is one of the main ways to upload/store files on a Meteor app and acts as an intermediary between the actual hosting server and the meteor server (which in itself is very limited in terms of space. I wanted to make a image hosting app and I got it to the point where I could upload the pictures to the database, but I could not take them back out and display them on my app :(</p>
        <h2 class="font-effect-3d-float">GridFS</h2><br>
        <p>GridFS is the way for people to host larger images on their Meteor app as it breaks down the image into at least two parts: one part is the meta data while the other part is the optimus data (I forgot the term)</p>
        <h2 class="font-effect-3d-float">AWS</h2><br>
        <p>Amazon Web Services is the actual hosting server that I used to try to create my image hosting website. It has a limited trial period for free users but is very comprehensive. A lot of money traps everywhere though.</p>
        <h2 class="font-effect-3d-float">Font Awesome</h2><br>
        <p>It's where I got the neato burrito plus and minus signs</p>
        <h2 class="font-effect-3d-float">Google Fonts</h2><br>
        <p>Google's so fun with this. Plus Oxygen is one of my top fav fonts because IT'S SO PRETTY</p>
